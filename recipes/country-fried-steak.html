        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Country-fried steak is made with cube steaks, a tenderized cut of meat that makes a great weeknight dinner entrée. We coated each steak in a crushed saltine cracker mixture, and then fried until golden brown. And, don't forget the gravy! </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (4-oz.) cube steaks</li>
                <li>2 3/4 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
                <li>2 1/4 teaspoons pepper, divided</li>
                <li>1 sleeve saltine crackers (approx. 38-40)</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups flour, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper</li>
                <li>8 3/4 cups whole milk, divided</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper onto cube steaks, flipping to season both sides. </li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine one sleeve (approximately 38-40) crushed saltine crackers, 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Whisk to combine. Add in an additional 1/2 tsp. of both salt and pepper to the combined cracker mixture, and stir in 1/2 tsp. ground red pepper. </li>
                <li> In a separate bowl, combine 4 3/4 cups milk and 2 eggs, whisking until eggs are completely incorporated. </li>
                <li>Coat each cube steak in flour mixture, then milk mixture, then flour mixture again, making sure that steaks are completely covered. </li>
                <li>Heat 4 cups of vegetable oil (or preferred frying oil) in a large skillet or Dutch oven, until oil is at 360˚F. Place prepared steaks in hot oil, frying for about 10 minutes until steaks are golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on a wire rack-lined jellyroll pan. </li>
                <li>FOR GRAVY: In a large bowl, combine 3/4 cup flour, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, and 4 cups of milk. Whisk ingredients together. Pour into a skillet with about 1 Tbsp. of remaining frying oil, and whisk on medium heat for about 10 minutes or until mixture has thickened. Pour warm gravy over country-fried steaks. Sprinkle with fresh parsley if desired. </li>
            </ol>
